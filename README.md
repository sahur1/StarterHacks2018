What happened to the last pair of glasses you had?
Don't want to spend hundreds of dollars buying new glasses?
Instead of having 5 'spare' glasses, why not empower the underprivileged?

At Re**vision**, we recycle, refurbish and resell old glasses at a fraction of the price!

1. Find a perfect pair of affordable, refurbished glasses for yourself with our filter feature.
2. Sell your old glasses and help those in need.
3. Wait for your new glasses to be shipped or visit a glass store to donate.
